What is react?
At the heart of react, are what are called "components".
We put these components together to form the entire app.

At the root will always be an "App" component

For example, we can split twitter into,
- Navbar
- Profile
- Trends
- Feed (can include several 'tweet components')
    - Tweet
    - Like

Each component is a peace of UI
--------------

Components are usually implemented using javascript, using a state and render()

Ex. class Tweet {
    state = {};
    render() {

    }
}

The output of the redner is a React element, which represents a DOM element in memory.
We will refer to React Elements as Virtual DOMs. Any changes to the virtual DOM will be made in the real DOM.
This is why the library is called REACT.


===================

Initializing the app
If you want to customize the configuration, run 'npm run eject'
'npm run start' will start the app

Don't gotta worry about node_modules folder

===================

Here are some javascript things that we will be using frequently

render() {
    return (
        <div className="App">
        ...
        </div>
    )
}
Inside the return statement is what is called jsx
Babel takes the jsx, and turns into plain javascript code that browsers can understand.

=======================

When handling a props javascript object, its important to remember that props is READ ONLY

If you need to modify the input of something, you have to change it in state

The component that owns a piece of state, should be the one modifying it

In the case we have here of counters/counter. We will have Counter raise the event, and have Counters
handle the event. We will pass the reference to the event via props.
